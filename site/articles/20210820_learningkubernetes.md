Learning Kubernetes

# [Learning Kubernetes](#) &mdash; 20 Aug, 2021

I just started working for a new company, [cloudmobility](https://cloudmobility.io), since I'm now working in a product which provides Kubernetes namespaces I really need to learn about Kubernetes.

To get a quick grasp I watching some youtube content and reading some documentation, in the result of that I'm also taking some notes that I will leave [here](https://highfalutin-alyssum-81e.notion.site/Kubernetes-97be9691b2f047cea2b8f778c8c6108c) for future reference. I will be updating those notes from time to time.
