Learning Symfony

# [Learning Symfony](#) &mdash; 04 Dec, 2021

In a not so distant future I was occasionaly coding in PHP, as the time passed I got more into Java and Spring, leaving PHP behind.

I'm trying to refresh my knownledge and gather new skills in the process, so I decided to take an Udemy course on Symfony. As I am taking the course I will be leaving some notes [here](https://pond-angle-0f9.notion.site/Symfony-f4adea8a1c334e02b8cd0f5cf7e18288) that you can use for you as well.

As always, if you find something wrong there feel free to suggest changes.
